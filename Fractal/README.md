Dojo "Fractal Forest"
===================

This Dojo is about creating fun and beautiful **fractal images** like this one:  
![alt text][simple-tree]  
... or this one?  
![alt text][kidney-tree]  
The dojo was inspired by the post ["Create Fractals with Recursive Drawing"](http://matthewjamestaylor.com/blog/create-fractals-with-recursive-drawing).
It is a good exercise in **recursion**.
This Dojo is **suitable for beginners**, and should be **doable in one hour**.
